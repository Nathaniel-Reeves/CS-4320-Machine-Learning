# About Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-student-performance-dataset?resource=download

## Description
This dataset is a synthetic representation of student performance, designed to mimic real-world scenarios by considering key factors such as study habits, sleep patterns, socioeconomic background, and class attendance. Each row represents a hypothetical student, and the dataset includes both input features and the calculated target variable (grades).

The dataset can be used for predictive modeling, exploratory data analysis, or even as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning workflows.

## Key Features
1. Study Hours
    * Description: Average daily hours spent studying.
1. Sleep Hours
    * Description: Average daily hours spent sleeping.
1. Socioeconomic Score
    * Description: A normalized score (0-1) indicating the student's socioeconomic background.
1. Attendance (%)
    * Description: The percentage of classes attended by the student.
1. Grades (TARGET)
    * Description: The final performance score of the student, derived from a combination of study hours, sleep hours, socioeconomic score, and attendance.

## Usage Notes

This dataset is synthetic and does not represent real students. It was created for educational and demonstration purposes.
While the dataset strives for realism, it includes controlled randomness and noise to simulate real-world data variability.

## Acknowledgments
This dataset is a beginner-friendly introduction to synthetic dataset creation, aiming to help the community experiment with realistic yet controlled data. Happy exploring! ðŸš€
